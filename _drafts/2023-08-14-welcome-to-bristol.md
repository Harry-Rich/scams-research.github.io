Today marks the first day of the Statistical Chemical Analysis Methods (SCAMs) group.
Andrew has made the trip over from Denmark to start the process of getting settled in at the new home of the University of Bristol School of Chemistry. 
He needs to return to Denmark to participate in the DMSC Summer School before moving to Bristol more permanently in the middle of September.

If anyone want to come visit to talk about some exciting new science, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.data.people[0].email }}) and we look forward to welcoming you to Bristol soon!
