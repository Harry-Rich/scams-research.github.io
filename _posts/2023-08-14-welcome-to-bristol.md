Today marks the start of the Statistical Chemical Analysis Methods (SCAMs) group at the University of Bristol. 
Yesterday, Andrew flew over from Copenhagen to start the process of getting settled in at the School of Chemistry. 
The next month will be busy with an international move (to end up in Bristol permanently in mid-September) and preparing for teaching on the [MSc program](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2023/sci/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science/).
