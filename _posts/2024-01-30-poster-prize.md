At the recent [Royal Society of Chemistry Solid State Chemistry Group Christmas Meeting](https://sscg2023.wixsite.com/xmas) in Edinburgh, Andrew and collaborators of the SCAMs@bristol research group were awarded the Materials Advances Prize for Computational Science for their poster introducing the methodology behind the [kinisi](https://kinisi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) software. 
The poster below is available (Andrew happily admits that he spent far too long working on it).

The Royal Society of Chemistry also prepared an excellent blog highlighting all of the prize winners at the SSCG Christmas Meeting that you can [read here](https://blogs.rsc.org/jm/2024/01/30/sscg-2023-prize-winners/).
