Back at the end of June (just before going on holiday to Spain, hence the shorts), Andrew was asked to present at a [Reproducibility by Design](https://www.reproducibilitybydesign.com) symposium in the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences at the University of Bristol. 
He used this opportunity to talk about [showyourwork](https://show-your.work/en/latest/) and the importance of computational reproducibility; this presentation is available as a video on YouTube (embedded below).

In addition to presenting himself, this was an excellent opportunity to interact with others interested in reproducibility in the sciences. 
Hopefully, there will be exciting cross-faculty projects coming along in the future!
