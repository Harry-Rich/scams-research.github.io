If you have an interesting chemical data analysis problem, we are always happy to hear about potential collaborations. 
If you are interesting in joining the {{ site.title }} team (either as a PhD student or a postdoc), we can look at potential opportunities and funding. 

Either way, drop [Andrew](mailto:{{ site.data.people[0].email }}) an email and he will try and arrange a time to chat.
