title: Bayesian model selection
---

Frequently, in the analysis of chemical data, there is more than one model that could describe the phenomena being observed or we want to understand how many parameters in a given model can be allowed to vary without "fitting an elephant".[^1] 
We use [Bayesian model selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor), to perform a rationale comparison between analytical models with different numbers of parameters to obtain a greater understanding of the analysis processes at hand. 

We have used Bayesian model selection to develop a framework for the interpretation of reflectometry analysis, ensuring that the maximum information density is obtained from a given analysis.[^2]
This approach is now being expanded to give an analytical understanding of the minimum resolvable lengthscales from reflectometry measurements[^3] and has been applied to rationally compare different analysis models to describe space-change layers in solid-electrolyte grain boundaries.[^4]
