title: Harnessing our prior knowledge and combining measurements
---

Another approach to use what we already know is the use of prior probabilistic descriptions and the combination of multiple measurement techniques. 

To use prior probabilistic descriptions from the literature, it is necessary to enable this through the creation of libraries of this data such that it may be used by anyone within existing analysis software.
This has been carried out in the production of the `avant` software, which works towards this in the domain of reflectometry analysis.[^1]

The combination of multiple measurements technique is not as straightforward as may be assumed, as different techniques offer different information. 
We have investigated this in the combination of neutron reflectometry and classical simulation; investigating the effect of different levels of particle coarse graining in the latter.[^2]
