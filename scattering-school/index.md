We are excited to announce the **Bristol/Diamond Light Source/ISIS Neutron and Muon School Scattering School**, to take place from the 23rd to the 25th of October 2024 at the University of Bristol School of Chemistry.
The aim of this school is to provide a comprehensive training in small-angle scattering and reflectometry, with a particular focus on the analysis of data from these techniques. 
The school is being organised by the SCAMs@bristol research group in conjunction with Diamond Light Source and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source. 

The event is free to attend but places are limited, registrations will open on the *2nd September 2024*.
